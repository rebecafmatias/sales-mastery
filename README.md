# Sales Mastery

Hey there! This is my sales analysis project in Python.

**Status:** Under construction, but we already have some cool stuff working!

Check out the functionalities that are already ready:

- We calculate the total sales per product, so you know which items are booming!
- We discovered which product is the customers' favorite and the one that generates the most profit.
- We analyzed sales per customer, so you know who your best buyers are.
- We found the customer who spent the most, he deserves an award!

Soon, we will have even more functionalities:

- We will calculate the average ticket so you have an idea of the average value of sales.
- We will group sales by date, so you can see how sales behave over time.
- And we will have a complete report with all the sales information, so you have everything organized!

Stay tuned, we will have news soon!
